      <p>
        All Andrew Fleck Children’s Services programs share a philosophy that is
        supportive of the right of every child and family to receive the highest
        quality of early learning and care that we can offer. Families know that
        we are committed to providing a high quality, multicultural, inclusive,
        early learning program for all children, in a nurturing environment that
        is respectful of each individual child’s needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through play, children learn how to learn. Our programs offer a
        child-focused curriculum where our teaching teams and children work
        together to expand and develop a wide range of skills and competencies
        based on the emergent curriculum philosophy which builds upon the
        interests of the children. It is often spontaneous and responsive to
        their immediate interests; topics are driven by the ideas and questions
        from the children themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer opportunities for growth and development in every area, while
        recognizing that each child is a unique individual. Parents are an
        integral part of our inclusive philosophy and we encourage families to
        be involved in the program as much as possible.
      </p>
