      <section>
        
        <p>AFCS began in 1911 and remains one of the oldest and most diversified non-profit, charitable, multi-service early learning, child care and family support organizations in Ottawa.</p>  

        <p> AFCS has always taken a leadership role in the child care community and in early childhood education in Ottawa. Over the past 100 years, in response to the changing needs of the community, it has developed innovative programs and expanded the organization to provide a comprehensive range of services that meet the diverse early learning and child care needs of families in the City of Ottawa. AFCS takes pride in being innovative, progressive, responsive and – most importantly – committed to excellence in all its services. </p>
            
        <p>AFCS advocates for high quality, affordable, accessible, accountable and inclusive child care that promotes the optimum physical, emotional, social, cognitive and intellectual development of the child.
